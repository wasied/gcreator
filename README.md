# GCreator
A script automatically creating a Garry's Mod addon base

### Installation and usage
1. Download the ``gcreator.cmd`` file from the Releases page (right-side of this page)
2. Move the ``gcreator.cmd`` file you just downloaded into your ``addons`` folder
3. Double-click on it and answer the questions. It's done, ggwp.

This script is automatically updated so **you don't need to come and download it every commit**.  
You can see the remote powershell script in **remote/gcreator.ps1**.
